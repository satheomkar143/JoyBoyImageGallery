        <h3>Make something awesome</h3>
        <p>JoyBoy was born from the pain we had in finding great, usable imagery. And we werenâ€™t alone. Which is why, today - millions of creators from around the world have downloaded over 4 billion JoyBoy images to create presentations, artwork, mockups, and more.</p>
