        <h2>How We Share Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement and governmental entities when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response to a facially valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies. We may also disclose your personal information to a third party in the event of any potential or completed reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business.
        </p>
        <p>
          We rely on third party services providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf, such as identity verification, detection of fraud or security threats, telephone or technical support, payment card processing, hosting services, and data storage or processing, and we may transfer your personal information to our service providers for such purposes. Third party service providers have access to and may collect personal information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p>

      <h1 class="title">Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is designed for use by people who are at least 18 years old. If you are not yet 18, then you can’t use the Service. If you are 18 or older, you promise to us that you have never been suspended from the Service, and promise that your use of the Service won’t break any laws or regulations. If you are using the Service on behalf of a company, organization, or other kind of entity, you represent to us that you have authority to bind the organization to these Terms on its behalf.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Accounts and Registration</h2>
        <p>When you use the Service, you have the opportunity to register an account. We suggest you do register an account, because creating an account on the Service gives you access to special features around discovery, downloading, and contributing to the community. If you do, we ask that you give us some information about yourself as part of the registration process, some of which is required in order to register the account. You promise that all the information you provide is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date in the future. We also ask you to provide a password to protect the security of your account. You are responsible for keeping your password safe and confidential. Any activity that happens under your account will be your responsibility. If ever you think that your account may no longer be secure, you need to notify us immediately.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Limited License to Use the Service (but not the Photos)</h2>
        <p>Conditioned on your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you permission to access the Service only for your personal use.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>License to Photos</h2>
        <p>One of the best features of the Service permits you to search, view, and download photographs that have been uploaded by JoyBoy users (“Photos”). You may download and use Photos from the Service in accordance with, and subject to, the JoyBoy License. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the JoyBoy License, as well as the accompanying FAQs. To be sure you don’t miss it, here’s the crux of the license:</p>
        <p>
          JoyBoy grants you an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from JoyBoy for free, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or JoyBoy, but this license does not include the right to compile photos from JoyBoy to replicate a similar or competing service.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Modifying these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may, at times, make changes to these Terms on 7 days’ notice. If and when we do, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes. We may provide these notices through a pop-up banner, by sending an email to an email address associated with your account on the Service, or in some other way, and we will let you know when the new version of these Terms will go into effect. If you don’t accept the new Terms that we are proposing, we may cancel your account immediately and terminate your access to the Service. If we have any disputes regarding the Service, they will be resolved in accordance with the version of these Terms that was in effect when the dispute arose.
